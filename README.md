# Picgo Plugin Compress Webp Lossless

This is a fork of the [picgo-plugin-compress](https://github.com/JuZiSang/picgo-plugin-compress) repository.

The original project has been inactive for quite some time. It's intended to provide continued maintenance and support.

This project is a plugin for [PicGo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo) and [PicGo-Core](https://github.com/PicGo/PicGo-Core), enabling image compression using the remote service provided by [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or local compression using [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin).

Additionally, it supports lossless converting images to the WebP format.

Several enhancements and updates have been implemented in this fork:

- **Dependency Upgrades**: The project dependencies have been updated to their latest versions, ensuring better compression efficiency.
- **Syntax Upgrade**: The codebase has been migrated to use ES modules, providing better compatibility with modern JavaScript ecosystems.
- **Lossless Compression**: Local image compression has been improved to offer lossless compression, resulting in better compression quality.

Feel free to contribute to this project or report any issues you encounter. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!
